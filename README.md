I felt like a bulldozer

Trying to catch a butterfly

Required libs
=============
* xorg-dev (Xrandr, X11)
* liblua5.1-0-dev (lua5.1)
* libgl1-mesa-dev (GL)
* libopenal-dev (openal)
* libphysfs-dev (physfs)
* Awesomium 1.6.5 (http://awesomium.com/download/) - Note: free for non-commercial and indie use (the line here is income over $100k/yr). Requires libjpeg62 to work - my system uses jpeg-turbo so I just extracted the lib from the debs in the Ubuntu package archives.

If you'd like to use an IDE instead of makefiles, just generate the files as needed with premake (e.g. <code>$ premake4 codelite</code>)
